# How Does It Work?
You use the executable and place it in a folder of your choice. When you open it you can choose between .dds, .png, .tif and .jpg formats. If you press enter, the programm will locate any convertable file in the same directory and any subdirectory and will start convert it in the selected format. This requieres the Space Engineers Mod SDK to be installed.
